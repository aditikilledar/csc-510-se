# About MyDollarBot's /display Feature's Graph module
This feature enables the user to see their expense in a graphical format to enable better UX.

Currently, the /display command will provide the expenses as a message to the users via the bot. To better the UX, we decided to add the option to show the expenses in a Bar Graph.

## Functions

1. visualize(total_text):
This is the main function used to implement the graphing part of display feature. This file is called from display.py, and takes the user expense as a string and creates a dictionary which in turn is fed as input matplotlib to create the graph

2. addlabels(x, y):
This function is used to add the labels to the graph. It takes the expense values and adds the values inside the bar graph for each expense type

After you've added sufficient input data, use the /display command and you can see the output in a pictorial representation.
