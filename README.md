| Criteria                           | Description                                                      | Rating |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Video**                          | 2min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from prior. | 2      |
| **Workload Distribution**          | Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often X times more productive than the others). | 3      |
| **GitHub Evidence**                |                                                              |        |
| Number of commits in GH           |                                                                  | 3      |
| Number of commits by different people in GH |                                                      | 3      |
| Issues reports: there are many    |                                                                  | 2      |
| Issues are being closed            |                                                                  | 3      |
| DOI badge: exists in GH           |                                                                  | 3      |
| **Documentation**                  |                                                              |        |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly in GH |                                                       | 3      |
| Docs: what - point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) in GH | 2      |
| Docs: how - for common use cases X, Y, Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X, Y, Z doc page entries | 0 (no mini-tutorials) |
| Docs: why - docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | 1 (story there but not engaging) |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code | 2 (could have been made shorter and used pictures instead of the video) |
| **Code Quality**                   |                                                              |        |
| Use of version control tools       |                                                                  | 3      |
| Use of style checkers - config files in GH showing your config | 2 (flake8 flake9 typo) |
| Use of code formatters - config files in GH showing your this formatter's config | 0   |
| Use of syntax checkers - config files in GH showing this checker's config | 0   |
| Use of code coverage - config files in GH |                        | 0      |
| Other automated analysis tools - config files in GH |            | 2      |
| **Testing**                        |                                                              |        |
| Test cases exist - dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base | 2 |
| Test cases are routinely executed - E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something | 3 (travis) |
| **Collaboration**                  |                                                              |        |
| The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up | 3 |
| Issues are discussed before they are closed - even if you discuss in slack, need a summary statement here | 1 (not discussed) |
| Chat channel: exists - Link or screenshots |                      | -      |
| Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it | - |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files | - |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | - |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) | - |
| Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base | 3 |
| Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work | - |
